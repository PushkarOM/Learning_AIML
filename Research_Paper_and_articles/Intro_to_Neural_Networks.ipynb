    "## Reasearch peper on Basic of Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Warren McCulloch -- in 1943 -- wrote a paper in How neurons might work -- Mathematician and Neurophysiologist.\n",
    "They modeled a simple neural network with electrical circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trained nerual netwrok can be thought of as an Expert.\n",
    "Adaptive Learning\n",
    "Self Orgranization : An ANN can create its own organisation or representation of the information it recives during learning time.\n",
    "Real Time Operations : ANN computaions may be carried out in parallel. -- special hardware -- GPUs\n",
    "Falt Tolerance via redundant infromation coding : partial destruction of a netwrok leads to the corresponding degradation of performance. However some neural networks capabilities maybe retained even with major network dmaage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally computers use --- Algorithms\n",
    "Unless these steps are know computer can't solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks Process Information in a simliar way to how a human brain does.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of a large  number of highly connect processing elements (neurons) working in parallel to solve a problem. They learn by example, and cannot be programmed to perform a specific task. The examples must be selected carefully otherwise time will be wasted in traning a network or at worst network might not function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "this is the disadvantage , the networks find the solution itself it's operation can be unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Artificial Neural Network ?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a really rough or crude electronic model based on the neural structue of the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of storing inforamtion as patterns, utilizing those patterns, and then solving problems encompasses a new feild in computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These typically consist of Hundereds of simple processing units which are wired together in a complex communication network. Each unit or node is a simplfied model of a neuron.\n",
    "It is a mathematical model or computational model, an information processing paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for many tasks :- Speech regonition, image analysis etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working of ANNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual Neurons and there netowrk is a 3D structure with semmingly inrestircted number of interconnection. But, that is not tru for the elctronically develop ANNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, neural networks are simple clustering of primitive artificial neurons. The clustering Occurs by creating layes which are then interconnected to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ther Structural Topology goes something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input layer ----> Hidden layers (ssss) ----> Output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "But the connection made between them is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neuron in a layer send output of 2 types to the other. To excite, and To inhibit.\n",
    "Ex, while regonizing the character P if the one neuron say 87% chance of this letter being P and 67% E then we want the neuron that say's P to excite and E to Inhibit. --- this gets a specific term Lateral inhibition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other way to through Feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traning of ANNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways -- supervised and unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Traning\n",
    "Here both the inputs and Output are provided for a set of data. The network then processes the inputs and compares it's output by the desired output. Errors are then Propogated back through the system, causing the system to adjust weights which control the netwroks output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converge -- a term used to indicate that the model provided desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime networks don't converge:-\n",
    "either the inputs provided do not related with the output desired.\n",
    "dataset might be small. -- train test split (ideally this should happend, meaning enough data should be present that it can be split in 2 sets).\n",
    "If an algo can simply not solve a problem the the structure likly needs a redesgin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many way to adjsut the weights, one of the most comman being Backwards Error propogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised or Adaptive learning\n",
    "Here network is provided with input but not the desired output. The system then itself must decied what features it will use to group the data. -- self organization.\n",
